This basic image classification model demonstrates how to build and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The steps involve loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, building a convolutional neural network, compiling, training, and evaluating the model. Once the model is trained, it can make predictions on new images, which can then be visualized.

This same process can be adapted for natural language processing tasks by using different layers (such as LSTMs or transformers) and text-specific preprocessing, but the core steps of loading data, model building, training, and evaluation remain the same.
